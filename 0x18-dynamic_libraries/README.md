# C - Dynamic libraries
This project is done in the aim of learning all about how **Dynamic Libraries** are created and also how we can write them at **ALX Full Stack Software Engineering** program.

## Technologies
* **C** files are compiled with **gcc**
* **Shell** files are written in **Bash**
* Tested on **UBUNTU 20.04 LTS**
